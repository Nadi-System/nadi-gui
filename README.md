# Nadi System GUI
This is a GUI to run Tasks and create graphical outputs.

Currently it can run any task and show a graphical representation of
the network. Although it is a GUI, only the graph part takes advantage
of the GUI part and the tasks still has to be run through text.

Here the left pane has table output, while right top shows a tasks
file and right bottom has a terminal. The tasks in the file can be run
in the terminal (auto runs the whole file on open/save). Anytime any
task is run, the graph is updated.

The graphics can be exported to PDF/SVG/PNG format.
